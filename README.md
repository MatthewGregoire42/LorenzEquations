# Lorenz Equations
A computational and mathematical exploration in the properties of the Lorenz equations

----

This repository is the result of a semester in the UNC mathematics department's directed reading program. I spent the semester learning methods of analyzing nonlinear systems, and then applied them to the Lorenz system.

The final presentation can be found in the `main.pdf` file in the Beamer folder. Feel free to tinker with the code I made as well. It was used to visualize trajectories and bifurcation diagrams of various nonlinear systems of differential equations.

If you use any part of this project elsewhere, please cite it by linking to this repository. Thanks!
